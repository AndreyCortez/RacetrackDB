<p>The Spa region has been associated with motor sport since the very early years of
racing. The first motor sport event in Belgium was organised by the Automobile Club de
Belgique in Spa with the &#145;Concours d'Automobiles&#146; meeting which was held in
1896. Two years later saw the first city to city race from Brussels to Spa. A year
afterwards, races were run from Brussels via Namur to Spa, followed a few days later with
a race from Spa to Brussels and a back to Spa. These early races were influential in
inspiring the &#145;<a href="../../Belgium/_gpArdennes.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/Belgium/_gpArdennes.html">Circuit des Ardennes</a>&#146;
races from 1902 to 1907, which took place on a triangular circuit of closed public roads
from Bastogne via Longlier to Habay-la-Neuve and back to Bastogne. In 1906 a city to city
race was organised from Spa to Luxembourg and back to the town of Malchamps, which is
located just to the north of the current Grand Prix circuit.</p>

<p>The Spa-Francorchamps circuit was established in August 1921. Conceived by Jules de
Their and Henri Langlois Van Ophem, the course consisted of 9.3 miles of fast and
undulating tree-lined public roads between the towns of Francorchamps, Malmedy and
Stavelot. The circuit was demanding, with many challenging, high speed corners. The first
event was a motorcycle race which took place in 1921. The first car races began in 1922
and it wasn&#146;t long before the circuit hosted international level competition,
starting in 1924 with the first <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.racingcircuits.net/_series/fia-stcc/spa24.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.racingcircuits.net/_series/fia-stcc/spa24.html'" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/_series/fia-stcc/spa24.html">Spa 24 Hours</a>
followed by the <a href="../../Belgium/_gp.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/Belgium/_gp.html">Belgian Grand Prix</a> in 1925. </p>

<p>The first incarnation of the circuit featured a sharp left turn at a bridge over the
Eau Rouge river immediately after the start/finish straight, which led the drivers around
the Ancienne Douanne loop, with the cars returning to Eau Rouge before climbing up the
hill up to Les Combes. The circuit then plunged downhill for a flat-out blast through the
quick and demanding Burnenville corner and through the curve at Malmedy. Cars then ran at
full speed along the valley bottom, sweeping through the Masta Kink, an unforgiving quick
left-right sequence with no margin for error. After another straight they flicked
right-left at Holowell, which led them into the hairpin at Stavelot. At this point the
circuit began to climb back up hill towards Francorchamps, passing through some incredibly
quick corners at La Carriére and Blanchimont, before heavy braking was required for the
tight right hand hairpin at La Source to complete the lap.</p>

<p>For the 1939 race the circuit was modified, the cars turning directly uphill at Eau
Rouge with the removal of the Ancienne Douanne section. After the end of the war, a new
banked link road was also established at Stavelot, which resulted in an increase in the
average speed over the course of a lap.</p>

<p>Because of the length of the circuit and the changeable local weather conditions, the
Spa circuit would become notorious for its unpredictability. Frequently, one section of
the circuit would be dry, whilst another would be deluged by a rainstorm. Combined with
the numerous trackside hazards, the slippery surface was extremely dangerous for the
competitors. Bill Holowell crashed fatally on the run down to Stavelot whilst in third
place on his 350cc AJS during the 1925 TT. In 1939 Dick Seaman crashed out of the lead of
the wet Grand Prix race in his Mercedes-Benz whilst negotiating the fast left curve before
La Source. His car hit a tree sideways on, and the driver was trapped unconscious inside
the burning wreckage. He would later die of his injuries. During the 1958 Grand Prix of
Spa for Sportscars, Archie Scott-Brown&#146;s Lister-Jaguar also crashed in the same area
after hitting a marker stone. He too received severe burns from which he tragically died.</p>

<p>The 1960 Belgian Grand Prix would be the among the blackest weekends of the
circuit&#146;s history. During practice, Mike Taylor suffered extensive injuries after
crashing his Lotus into a tree and Stirling Moss broke both his legs when he was thrown
from his Lotus following an axle failure. During the race Chris Bristow lost control of
his Cooper at Burnenville and was decapitated after sliding off into a fence. Five laps
later Alan Stacy was hit in the face by a bird near Masta and died when his Lotus left the
road and crashed heavily.</p>

<p>A year later Cliff Allison rolled his Lotus and suffered career ending injuries to his
legs. During the 1962 event, Trevor Taylor&#146;s Lotus tangled with Willie
Mairesse&#146;s Ferrari just after Blanchimont, with Mairesse suffering severe burns.
Lancia driver Piero Frescobaldi suffered a fatal accident during the 1964 Spa 24 Hours.
The 1966 Belgian Grand Prix featured a heavy downpour just after the start, which
eliminated half the field in the opening lap. Jackie Stewart lost control of his BRM at
the Masta Kink and was trapped in his overturned car, which was leaking fuel. He suffered
a broken shoulder and ribs, and also internal bruising. It was an experience that would
prove influential in his quest to improve safety in Formula 1. At Blanchimont a year
later, Mike Parkes spun on oil and rolled his Ferrari several times. He was thrown from
the car and sustained massive leg injuries, which would end his racing career. This
followed the tragic deaths of Wim Loos and Eric De Keyn who each crashed their Alfa
Romeo&#146;s during the 24 Hour race. The 1969 running of the 24 Hours would see the
fatality of Leon Dernier following an accident in his Mazda R 100.</p>

<p>In 1970 a chicane was introduced at Malmedy for the Grand Prix cars in an effort to
improve driver safety. However, this would prove to be the last Belgian Grand Prix held on
the original Spa circuit, as it was decided that it had become too dangerous for Formula
1. The series would instead race at the featureless <a href="../../Belgium/Nivelles.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/Belgium/Nivelles.html">Nivelles-Baulers</a>
in 1972 and 1974, before settling for a home at <a href="../../Belgium/Zolder1965.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/Belgium/Zolder1965.html">Zolder</a>.
In the meantime however, the Spa 24 Hours would continue to be held on the circuit. The
1971 event saw the death of BMW driver Raymond Mathay, whilst 1973 saw the deaths of
drivers Massimo Larini, Hans-Peter Joisten and Roger Dubos. Wim Boshuis crashed fatally in
his Opel Commodore during the 1975 running of the 24 Hour race.</p>

<p>In 1979 a new link road was built connecting the circuit from Les Combes to point on
the return road from Stavelot to Blanchimont. This significantly reduced the length of the
circuit and was a great improvement in terms of safety. With the introduction of the Bus
Stop chicane at the old Clubhouse corner in 1981, Formula 1 returned for the 1983 season
and would finally become the venue for Grand Prix from 1985 and beyond.</p>
