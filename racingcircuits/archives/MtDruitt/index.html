<p><big>Mount Druitt - Australia</big></p>

<p>Type: Airfield Circuit<br>
Length: 2.400 miles</b></font></p>

<p>The Mount Druitt circuit was <font size="3">built on the remnants of a</font> second
world war airstrip <font size="3">which was located to the west of Sydney</font>. In 1950,
the circuit was leased by Belfred Jones, and the venue became the host circuit of
Australian Racing Drivers Club. <font size="3">The original variant, which was used during
the years after the war, was gradually extended to a 2.4 mile configuration during 1951.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 31st of January 1954, the Mount Druitt circuit was the last venue
to host a 24-hour race in Austalia for almost forty-nine years. The wet endurance race was
won by Australia's Bill Pitt, Geordie Anderson and Charles Swinburne in a Jaguar XK120,
and proved to be a car breaker as the track surface broke up during the event, with the
resulting damage contributing to several retirements.</font></p>

<p>The circuit was closed spectacularly in 1958, when Belfred Jones cut a trench around
the circuit using a <font size="3">mechanical digger, following a dispute between himself,
the ARDC and the regulatory body. This action resulted in the circuit been unusable for
racing, and sections of the trench can still be seen today.</font></p>

<p>Today, the circuit is all but completely unrecognisable. A suburb was built over the
eastern section of the circuit in the 1960's and the airstrip section has since been
converted into the Whalan Reserve sports complex, however a few sections of the circuit do
remain if you know where to look.</p>
