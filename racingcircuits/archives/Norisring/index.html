target="_blank">located</a> in the south-eastern suburbs of Nürnburg. It is based on the
roads surrounding the Steintribüne, a large structure opposite the Zeppelinfeld, from
which Hitler would make speeches during the second world war. The 'Noris' part of the
circuit name is derived from the Latin name for Nürnberg. The present layout is simply
two kinked straights joined at either end by hairpins, with a 'S' bend on the back
straight. Despite its short length, the roads are wide which helps to encourage
overtaking. The first races were held in the late forties and throughout the fifties for
motorcycles, with sportscar races later introduced successfully during the sixties. Pedro
Rodriguez was killed during the 1971 race, and the circuit was consequently shortened the
following year. In the ninties, touring cars replaced the sportcars for the feature race.</p>
