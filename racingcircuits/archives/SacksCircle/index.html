<p></b></i>The circuit was situated in the Cape Town suburb of Bellville. The first race
to be held on Sacks Circle was the 8th False Bay 100 on 1 January 1959. This was a road
circuit that was built by Denis Mills, the son of a pre-WW2 South African racing driver,
in a newly developed industrial area at the time. Racing took place over a period of two
years, before the Killarney circuit became the permanent home of motorsport in the Cape
Town region.<br>
<br>
British driver, Chris Bristow, had a major accident here in 1960, when he flipped an Alfa
Spider Veloce in a production car race after he went into Airport Bend too fast. The car
slid upside down for more than 30 yards along the road on over the railway lines, shedding
bits of bodywork along the way.</p>
