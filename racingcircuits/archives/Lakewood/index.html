target="_blank">located</a> on the site of the Pooles Creek Reservior. The flat one mile
dirt oval was at times also known as the &quot;Grand Old Lady of Racing&quot; and the
&quot;Indianapolis of the South&quot;. The course was laid out around the perimeter of the
lake, with specators seated in the main grandstand at the end of the the front straight
and also on the grass banking around the track. For the first couple of years, motorsport
events were restricted to motorcycle racing. The first car race took place on the 28th of
July 1917, featuring match races won by Ralph DePalma and Barney Oldfield. In the late
40's and through the 50's the track hosted numerous rounds of the both the NASCAR Grand
National series and the AAA/USAC National Championship. The surface however was a constant
hazard, as the worn out clay caused clouds of dust to be formed during the races. These
dust clouds were the cause of a double fatality at the end of the 1946 Atlanta 100-Mile
Race, when <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.racingcircuits.net/_series/irl/indy500.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.racingcircuits.net/_series/irl/indy500.html'" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/_series/irl/indy500.html">Indy 500</a> winner George Robson
failed to spot Billy DeVore's slow moving car and the two collided, causing a pileup that
resulted in the deaths of both Robson and George Barringer. In 1950, NASCAR driver Skimp
Hersey died in hospital after his car crashed and caught fire; the driver escaping from
the wreckage and sitting on the track.engulfed in flames. In 1960, the <a
href="../../UnitedStates/ga/Atlanta1960.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/UnitedStates/ga/Atlanta1960.html">Atlanta International Raceway</a> was
opened, the competition from this new venue contributing towards Lakewood's decline.
Despite resurfacing and infrastructure improvements in 1967, and a suggestion to pave the
track to attract NASCAR events, the venue eventually closed on the 3rd of September 1979.</p>

<p>Today, the grandstands and turn 1 are all that's left. A parking lot for an
amphitheatre now occupies the area that used to be turns 3 &amp; 4, and a road leading to
that amphitheatre cuts across turn 2. The front straight is now paved as part of a road
leading out onto Lakewood Avenue. Also, much of the lake has been filled in.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="1.jpg" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/archives/Lakewood/1.jpg" width="600" height="417"><br>
The 1st photo is taken on the front straight about halfway from the turn 4 area to turn 1.
The entrance into turn 1 can be seen, as well as the grandstands to the right. The light
pole on the right is just about where the start/finish line would have been.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2.jpg" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/archives/Lakewood/2.jpg" width="600" height="344"><br>
The 2nd photo shows the grandstands from the front straight, just before the start/finish
line.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="3.jpg" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/archives/Lakewood/3.jpg" width="600" height="392"><br>
In the 3rd photo you can see the entrance to turn 1.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="4.jpg" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/archives/Lakewood/4.jpg" width="600" height="308"><br>
The 4th photo looks back from the middle of turn 1 toward the grandstands.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="5.jpg" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/archives/Lakewood/5.jpg" width="600" height="438"><br>
The 5th photo shows the edge of the lake, the apex between turns 1 &amp; 2, and how turn 2
now ends against the road leading into the amphitheatre. That area of the lake on the
inside of turn 1 is really the only area of the lake still left that hasn't been filled in
or in some other way altered.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="6.jpg" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/archives/Lakewood/6.jpg" width="600" height="424"><br>
This view from the grandstands looks into turn 1. You can see the edge of the lake and the
end of the pit area also.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="7.jpg" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/archives/Lakewood/7.jpg" width="600" height="434"><br>
From the same vantage point you see back toward the old turns 3 and 4. When I was last at
Lakewood for AMA bike races in the 70's, my father and I sat just about at this point.
You'd lose sight of the bikes as they went into 4, as even without the overgrowth, the
grandstand masked the sight line onto the main straight. All of a sudden the bikes would
explode into view, almost laying down sideways to lose speed into turn 1. It remains one
of the most exciting places I've ever watched racing.</p>
