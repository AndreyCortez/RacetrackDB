<p align="left">Situated about 10km Northeast of the Cape Town city center. Racing first
took place here in 1947, albeit only on an old stretch of road that had once formed part
of the main road from Cape Town to Malmesbury. Shortly afterwards, a link was built to
transform the strip into a very basic circuit. Since then it has become the home of
motorsport in the Western Cape Province and the circuit has seen four different formats
over the years. The <a href="../../SouthAfrica/Killarney1951.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/SouthAfrica/Killarney1951.html">original</a>
configuration was shaped like a narrow triangle with a tight hairpin corner also forming
part of this circuit in the vicinity of the present Sabat corner (ex-Malmesbury Sweep). In
<a href="../../SouthAfrica/Killarney1952.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/SouthAfrica/Killarney1952.html">1952</a>, the 'Tower Bend' and 'Big Sweep'
sections were added; the remains of these corners are still visable today in the access
road that circumnavigates the clubhouse. In <a href="../../SouthAfrica/Killarney1955.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/SouthAfrica/Killarney1955.html">1955</a>,
the circuit was extended again to include the present day hairpin at Cape Town Corner (now
Vodacom). The <a href="../../SouthAfrica/Killarney.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/SouthAfrica/Killarney.html">current</a> circuit is 3.267 km
in length and originates from 1960. No significant changes have been made since then,
apart from run-off areas and other safety related changes. The pit complex has been
upgraded and several workshops and garage facilities have been erected for competitors.</p>
