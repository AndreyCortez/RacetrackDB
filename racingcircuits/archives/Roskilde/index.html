<p>This circuit opened in 1955 as a 670 metre circuit, which then was extended to 1400
metres in the summer of 1957. The &quot;old&quot; circuit was still used for a couple of
years (last year must have been 1958), and the tarmac of that circuit was kept intact
until the circuit held its last meeting in the autumn of 1968. The direction was
anticlockwise.</p>

<p>Advertising was painted directly onto the asphalt of the banked turns, which proved to
be hazardous in the wet. The aerial photograph below was shot just weeks before the
extended circuit opened in August 1957.</p>

<p>From 1960 to 1962 the circuit hosted the non-championship <a
href="../../Denmark/_gp.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/Denmark/_gp.html">Danish Grand Prix</a>, with the races been spilt into heats.
Sports car races where also held, the most promenant being the &quot;Copenhagen Cup&quot;.
The overall lap record was set on September 22nd 1968 by Reine Wisell, who took his Tecno
F3 round the circuit in 42.0s.</p>

<p>The circuit closed at the end of 1968 when the local council elected not to renew the
organisers lease. The circuit's actual location was very close to the centre of the town
of Roskilde, which is situated about 25 miles west of Copenhagen. Today, the area is
partly used for a park, partly for a Scandic Hotel.</p>
