<p>The Bugatti circuit was designed by Charles Deutsch and constructed in 1965, utilising
the start/finish straight and first corner of the <a href="../../France/LeMans68.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/France/LeMans68.html">Sarthe
circuit</a>. The circuit then wound its way around the back of the pit garages through a
series of hairpin bends to complete the lap. From the mid 70's to the early 90's the
French Motorcycle GP alternated between the circuit and <a
href="../../France/PaulRicard1970.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/France/PaulRicard1970.html">Paul Ricard</a>. Apart from hosting the Formula 1 <a
href="../../France/_gp.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/France/_gp.html">French Grand Prix</a> in 1967, the circuit was not used
regularly by cars until 1986, from when it regulary hosted a Formula 3000 race. During
qualifying for the French Motorcycle Grand Prix of 1995, Alberto Puig suffered career
ending injuries and consequently the circuit underwent significant changes to its layout
in an attempt to improve safety. As a result of these changes, (and the unavailability of
Paul Ricard following its conversion to the HTTT), the MotoGP returned in 2000.</p>

<p>The cars shown on the circuit in the following photographs are from the racing school.</p>
