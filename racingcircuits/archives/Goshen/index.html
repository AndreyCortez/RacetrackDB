<p>Oregon International Raceway was located one and a half miles to the south of Goshen on
the east side of Interstate 5, at the Peebles Road overpass. Designed by John Hugenholtz,
the circuit opened on the 4th June 1964, but later flooded due to it's proximity to the
Willamette River. This damaged the track surface and funds could not be raised to carry
out the necessary repairs. Consequently, the circuit closed just two years after first
opening. </p>

<p>The Short Mountain Landfill facility was established on the site in 1976, incorporating
some of the existing circuit roads. Over time, much of the course was buried or dug over,
however traces of the original circuit layout are still visible on recent aerial <a

alterations on the ground that have taken place over the years, it is difficult in some
areas to ascertain the precise route of the course.</p>
