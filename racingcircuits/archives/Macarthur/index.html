    <td valign="top"><a name="marker"></a><u><em>The heritage marker text reads:</em></u><p><strong>From
    1978-1981 the streets of Macarthur made motorcycling history.</strong></p>
    <p>In the late 1970s, Macarthur&#146;s vacant residential blocks and empty streets caught
    the imagination of the newly-formed Canberra Road Racing Club (CRRC). The suburb&#146;s
    natural amphitheatre, perfect road surfaces and modern spoon-shaped drains were the
    ingredients for a dream road racing circuit!</p>
    <p>In 1978 the National capital Development Commission (NCDC) gave permission for the CRRC
    to conduct the first of a series of motorcycle race meetings, and &#145;Macarthur
    Park&#146; as the area became known, came to life.</p>
    <p>The first meeting attracted national media attention and an estimated 10,000 spectators
    &#150; 3,000 people watched the practice sessions!</p>
    <p>Macarthur Park was a unique experience for everyone who rode there. Well-known racers
    of that era &#150; and racers who went on to achieve national and international status in
    the motorcycling world &#150; diced alongside club riders from ACT, Victoria and NSW.</p>
    <p>The CRRC held other informal events between 1978-81, and the circuit was also used for
    kart racing and as a stage on the Castrol International Rally. By 1983 the first houses
    appeared and Macarthur Park became a memory. </p>
    <p>Today the only clue to this suburb&#146;s spectacular racing past is a small section of
    missing median strip at the Coyne Street intersection. Removed to allow for sidecar racing
    in 1981, it was never replaced.</p>

<p align="left">The story is partly told on the marker, but there are a couple of other
angles that are not mentioned.&nbsp; The reason the suburb was available for so long was
that in the mid to late 70s Canberra's population suddenly stopped growing for a
while.&nbsp; The government did not react quickly enough, so the suburb-building program
got ahead of demand, and there were three or four suburbs out here with nobody to move
into them. &nbsp; It was a great place for teaching kids to drive!&nbsp; The bikers cut a
deal with the government to put Macarthur at the bottom of the list for settlement, so
they had four or five years to run their races.&nbsp; Eventually, however, the demand
picked up again and the Government needed Macarthur.&nbsp; It was not a case of people who
don't like noise stampeding to build their houses near a circuit.&nbsp; The suburb was
intended to be built on from the beginning, and that's why the roads were built.&nbsp; It
was a small mercy that some races were able to be run before the inevitable houses
arrived.</p>
