<p><big>This website has its origins in 1994 when I first became interested in motor
racing. The initial collection of Formula 1 circuit plans on my computer were soon
supplemented with those from other racing series such as IndyCar, GT Racing and
Motorcycling. My collection then progressed to include circuits used in national
championships in the United Kingdom, then to those on the European continent and finally
the rest of the world. </big></p>

<p><big>In 1996 I first published my collection of circuit plans on the internet for the
benefits of other motor racing enthusiasts. Over the following two years my collection
expanded to include local club racing circuits and defunctional venues. At this point, the
format of the site was altered to include contact information for each track where
possible.</big></p>

<p><big>From 2000, I expanded my collection to include details of circuit variants,
including historical configurations. It was at this time that I also began to develop the
'<a href="../_series/index.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/_series/index.html" target="country">Racing Series</a>' section of the
website, which includes season by season calendars for all of the major racing series
together with details of the race winner and a link to the circuit configuration that was
used for the event.</big></p>

<p><big>During the first quarter of 2001 I performed a complete update of the site and
added pages for <a href="../sources.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/sources.htm">Information Sources</a>, <a
href="../history02.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/history02.html">Site Update History</a> and a links page for each country and
series. Later in the year, I began a <a href="../archives/index.html" tppabs="http://www.racingcircuits.net/archives/index.html">Photo Archive</a> of
racing circuits for photographs which have kindly been donated for display.</big></p>

<p><big>The website is still very much a &quot;work in progress&quot; and I anticipate
that this shall remain the case for the considerable future! I have not made any money
from this site since it was developed and nor do I intend to. Advertising banners, popups
and animated graphics slow down your browsing process and so they are not supported or
welcome here! Thanks to the people at <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.freeola.net/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.freeola.net/'" tppabs="http://www.freeola.net/">freeola.net</a>
this site is hosted free of charge and has unlimited space, so there is still plenty of
room for future expansion.</big></p>

<p><big>Hopefully, I have designed the website to be as accessible, fast and reliable as
possible. I hope that you continue to enjoy referring to the information on this site as
much as I enjoy creating and maintaining it!</big></p>
